## Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures** - a named location that can be used to store and organize data.
**Algorithm** - a collection of steps to solve a problem.

**Data Structures**

- **Stacks 📚**

  - Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.
  - Stores objects into a sort of "vertical tower"
  - push() to add to the top
  - pop() to remove to from the top

    **Uses of stacks?**

    1. Undo/Redo features in text editors.
    2. Moving back/forward through browser history.
    3. Backtracking algorithms (maze, file directories)
    4. Calling functions (call stack)

- **Queues 🎟️**

  - First In First Out (FIFO) data structure (ex. a line of people)
  - A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing linear data structure
  - add = enqueue, offer()
  - remove = dequeue, poll()
  - examine = element(), peek()

    **Uses of stacks?**

    1. Keyboard buffer (letters should appear on the screen in order they're pressed)
    2. Printer Queue (print jobs should be completed in order)
    3. Used in Linkedlists, PriorityQueues, Breadth-first search
